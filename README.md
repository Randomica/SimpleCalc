Simple calculator with Nodejs

Hey there!
this is a simple calculator. It's made up of a module called calcFunctions.js which comprises the four operators functions.
This module is recalled in the main app, calc.js.
It asks for the operation to be executed, then it checks if the chosen operation is a supported one, and if yes, it asks for the numbers to operate with.

Enjoy!
